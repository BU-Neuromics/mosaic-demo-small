"""Live schema grounding: hippoSchema + the capability manifest, fetched fresh every run.

Never cache these across sessions and never assume field names from memory. mosaic#149 (now
fixed, PR#150) was exactly this hazard: a plausible-looking guess silently produced a
wrong-but-valid-shaped answer. Unknown names are loud now, but the discipline stands -- resolve
names from the live schema rather than guessing a transformation.
