"""Turn-taking planning core for the Aperture-Exon conversational contract
(add-exon-conversational-contract, design.md Decisions 1/2/4).

This is ONLY the planning core: one stateless function turning (an existing
QuerySpec or none, the prior turns, a new utterance) into a single
{status, message, query_spec} decision -- exactly Decision 3's pure-function
contract, at the smallest scope that is independently useful and testable.

Deliberately NOT included here (separate, later increments -- see
tasks.md Phase 1/2):
  - Turn id assignment, rewind-and-edit recompute-and-suspend bookkeeping
    (Decision 5). This module decides ONE turn; the orchestration layer that
    manages a turns list, assigns ids, and recomputes after an edit is a
    distinct piece of state-management logic layered on top, not planning.
  - The HTTP endpoint (design.md Decision 8's wire contract). This module
    has no network surface at all -- it is a plain function, tested without
    a server, the same order upstream built parse_query_spec/
    validate_query_spec before wrapping them in MCP tools.

Reuses spec_planner.py's capability grounding, SPEC_TOOL's QuerySpec shape,
and its normalizers directly rather than re-deriving them -- a turn's
query_spec is the exact same artifact spec_planner.py's single-shot mode
emits, just conditioned on a conversation instead of one instruction.
